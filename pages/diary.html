        Recently, I started listening to an English podcast, and I found it very funny, I suppose.
        The main purpose is to learn some RP (Received Pronunciation), and I hope that someday I can speak fluent British English like the podcast host does.
        By the way, I've recently started learning Japanese. I hope I can grasp it quickly! ;)

        Hello guys, It's been a long time since I last post my diary. Recently I'm a little bit busy, I went to the pub at the Friday and, I've changed a lot because that.
        Just a couple days ago, I was really confused and quite lost in a maze named "Relationship". But don't worry, I'm back now, and I'm quite love the present status that I am.Yeah, I'm back!
        And I begin to write done the words and sectence that I heard in the Podcast recently. It's a time cost project but I think I can learn a lot from it, like learning the commen words
        that those native speaker often use, practicing my hearing, and polish my accent for example. I think I have quite a big progress right now, and I'm happy with that. And, you know, 
        I have worked out a lot these days, which I'm qiute enjoy that, it makes me feel great and stronger than before. And, you know, It can really calms me down, when I was lost myself and do not what I should do.<br>
        Anyway, I'm quite good right now, and I believe I will be better in the future! Thank you folks.Bye, Bye...
